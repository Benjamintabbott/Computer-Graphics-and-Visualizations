# Computer-Graphics-and-Visualizations

I think that my work on this project has helped me craft many design skills that can help me in the future. I believe that the functions and logic that was implemented to place and alter objects in a 3D world gave me great practice on developing software. To complete this project I followed the cumulative approach laid out by the instructor. This included starting with a small object and elaborating that and adding onto that inorder to create the final scene.  I think this approach of starting small and continuing to add on gives you a solid foundation on where to build and is a useful lesson for furture work. This strategy of iterative development let me understand each step and implement it individually. 

This course on computational graphics and visualizatiosn has given me a greater knowledge to how 3D rendering and programs work. It let me see behind what you can see on the screen and how what you see is actually created.
